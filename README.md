The Whiteside Model  
**A Quantitative Framework for Circadian-Mitotic-Spatial Stem Cell Regulation**

## Overview  
This preprint proposes the *Whiteside Model*, a novel framework that integrates four coupled biological oscillators to explain tissue-specific regulation of stem cell behavior. These oscillators include:

- **Circadian Gating** (BMAL1/CLOCK)
- **Mitotic Timing** (WEE1)
- **Metabolic Control** (MYC)
- **Spatial Signaling** (WNT)

A fifth component, **Survivin**, is introduced as a stress-responsive amplifier that maintains mitotic fidelity under adverse conditions.

The model provides a mechanistic basis for enforcing the five biological rules of epithelial tissue organization proposed by Boman et al. (2025), offering predictive insights into chronotherapy, regenerative medicine, and cancer treatment.

## Key Contributions
- Introduces a unified quantitative equation for mitotic permission (MP)
- Defines circadian phase-specific windows for mitosis
- Identifies threshold dynamics for system collapse under MYC dysregulation or WNT/BMAL1 loss
- Proposes Survivin as a downstream failsafe for tissue integrity
- Adapts model parameters across multiple tissue types (colonic crypts, skin, hematopoietic, hair follicles)
