# Whiteside Model – Full Hypothesis (2025)

This document outlines the core hypothesis behind the **Whiteside Model**, a four-oscillator framework for circadian-spatial stem cell regulation. It provides a comprehensive description of the model’s structure, including:

- Quantitative coupling of circadian (BMAL1/CLOCK), mitotic (WEE1), metabolic (MYC), and spatial (WNT) oscillators
- Mathematical expressions for mitotic permission (MP) and Survivin stress amplification
- Tissue-specific failure modes and resilience patterns
- Predictive hypotheses for regenerative medicine and cancer chronotherapy
- Core references from foundational literature

This version (v2) includes a reference section for citation transparency and OSF compliance.
